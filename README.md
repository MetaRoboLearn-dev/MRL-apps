# ü§ñ MetaRoboLearn - Code
_Code_  is a project developed and documented as part of an undergraduate thesis at the [University of Zagreb, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/) with prof. dr. sc. [Ivica Botiƒçki](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/ivica.boticki) as my mentor and advisor. The formal name of the thesis is "_Development of Application for Program Development and Simulation of Robot Control_".

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview
The whole idea behind the application is to provide a fun and visually attractive way for primary and middle school children to develop their programming thinking and learn basic program flow. This is achieved by allowing them to write their code directly within the interface and run it either in a customizable 3D simulation of a car guiding it through a forest to reach its home, or on a real life robot vehicle that receives commands wirelessly.
